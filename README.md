# On automated price model choice in the cloud - Model Implementation

The implementation for the cost model introduced in the bachelor's thesis "On automated price model choice in the cloud".

## Running

This version of the model is implemented in *R*. 
As such you need to have R installed on your computer, see [here](https://www.r-project.org/).
I also depend on various R packages that are not part of the basic installation.
These should install automatically when running any file. 
If they don't, please look at the list in `util.R` and install them manually.

To generate the plots used in the paper, please execute the respective code blocks in the `plots.R` file.
